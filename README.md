# adi-tsconv

Repository for take-home test as part of Round 2 of the interview with ADI

## Objectives

- [x] Implement a baseline UNet model with Conv2D Layers.
- [x] Implement a new layer architecture, time-shift convolution (TSConv) layer
- [ ] Implement the improved UNet with the TSConv Layers.
- [ ] Tests and documentation

## Implementation Details

1. Pytorch is the library of choice for this implementation. Primarily due to the ease of use of the nn.Module.
